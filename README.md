# Movie-Reviews
The project "Movies Review Text Classification using SVM Algorithm and Multinomial Naive Bayes" focuses on applying natural language processing (NLP) techniques to classify movie reviews into different categories using two different algorithms: Support Vector Machines (SVM) and Multinomial Naive Bayes (MNB).
The project involves the following steps:

Data Collection: Gather a dataset of movie reviews, which should include both positive and negative reviews. This dataset can be obtained from various sources such as online movie review databases or publicly available datasets.

Data Preprocessing: Clean and preprocess the collected data by removing any irrelevant information, such as HTML tags or special characters. Perform text normalization techniques such as lowercasing, tokenization, and removing stop words to prepare the text for further analysis.

Feature Extraction: Convert the preprocessed text into numerical features that can be used as input for the classification algorithms. Common techniques include bag-of-words representation or TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency) vectorization.

Splitting the Dataset: Divide the dataset into training and testing sets. The training set will be used to train the SVM and MNB models, while the testing set will be used to evaluate their performance.

Model Training: Train the SVM algorithm using the training set. SVM is a supervised learning algorithm that aims to find an optimal hyperplane to separate the positive and negative movie reviews. Additionally, train the MNB algorithm, which is a probabilistic classifier based on Bayes' theorem.

Model Evaluation: Evaluate the performance of the trained models using the testing set. Calculate metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score to assess the models' ability to classify movie reviews correctly.

Model Comparison: Compare the performance of the SVM and MNB algorithms based on the evaluation metrics. Analyze their strengths and weaknesses in terms of accuracy, speed, and interpretability.

Model Deployment: Once the preferred algorithm is selected, deploy the chosen model as a functional system that can classify new movie reviews into positive or negative categories. This can be done by creating a user-friendly interface or integrating the model into an existing application.

Continuous Improvement: Monitor the model's performance and gather feedback from users to identify any issues or areas for improvement. Fine-tune the models based on new data or explore other advanced NLP techniques to enhance their classification accuracy.

In summary, this project utilizes NLP techniques to classify movie reviews into positive or negative categories using SVM and MNB algorithms. It involves data collection, preprocessing, feature extraction, model training, evaluation, comparison, deployment, and continuous improvement to create an effective text classification system for movie reviews.
